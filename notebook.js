You can write Javascript, see it executed, and write comprehensive documentation using markdown.\n\n- Click any text cell (including this one) to edit it.\n- The code in each editor is all joined together into one file. If you define a variable in cell #1, you can refer to it in any following cell.\n- You can show any React component, string, number, or anything else by calling the `show` function. This is a function built into this environment. Call show multiple times to show multiple values.\n- Re-order or delete cells using the buttons on the top right.\n- Add new cells by hovering on the divider between each cell.\n\n\nAll of your changes get saved to the file you opened JBook with. So if you ran `npx jbook-cli serve test.js`, all of the text and code you write will be saved to the `test.js` file.\n\nNote: \n- If no file was provided when serving, then a default `notebook.js` will be created instead.\n- You can share these generated files so other people can import your jbook content.","type":"text"}]
